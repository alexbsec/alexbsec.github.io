# Cecil Daemon's Wish

Welcome to the GitHub repository of "Cecil Daemon's Cyber Chronicles" - a Jekyll blog where cybersecurity meets the mystique of Ragnarok Online. This blog is a blend of technical insights, CTF walkthroughs, and a touch of humor, all wrapped up in a Ragnarok-themed adventure.

## About the Blog

"Cecil Daemon's Wish" is a platform where I, Alex Buschinelli (Jo√£o Buschinelli in Brazil), share my journey as a Cybersecurity Analyst, CTF player, Bug Bounty Hunter, and a cosmology physicist. The blog features write-ups on various cybersecurity topics, CTF solutions, and my personal projects, with a unique twist inspired by the world of Ragnarok Online.
