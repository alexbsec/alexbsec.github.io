As a Cybersecurity Analyst moonlighting as a CTF wizard and Bug Bounty Hunter, I juggle the digital realms much like a Ragnarok adventurer traverses through Rune Midgard. With a trusty Python staff in hand for over four years, I've also dabbled in the arcane arts of JavaScript, C/C++, Ruby, and Go. My quest for knowledge is unending, with a keen eye on mastering the dark arts of Malware Analysis and Web Exploitation, while also conjuring up some app development magic on the side.

Greetings! I'm Alex Buschinelli - or Jo√£o Buschinelli in Brazil: a cosmology physicist adventuring through the cyber world.
